/*
This is an example of how to send HTTP requests to a backend
fetch starts the process, it can have a second argument, but doesn't now. 
Fetch is a promise, and can't act right away, because the rest of my app needs data to 
do it's job. That's where then() comes in. then() takes my response and reads it as json 
since that's how this particular API was written. Once the data is read as json, another promise, 
then I transform it to fit with how my app is written. I could have changed my app to match 
the API, but this is good practice. At the end of my transformation, I set the movies using
setMovies, and that is why useState is an empty array.  THis was originally built with a then() chain
seen below

  const fetchMoviesHandler = () => {
    fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/films/")
      .then((response) => {
        return response.json();
      })
      .then((data) => {
        //the following transforms the information from the api to make it fit into my app names
        const transformedMovies = data.results.map((movieData) => {
          return {
            id: movieData.episode_id,
            title: movieData.title,
            openingText: movieData.opening_crawl,
            releaseDate: movieData.release_date,
          };
        });
        setMovies(transformedMovies);
      });
  };

  but I can also use async.
